Code Book for "tidydata":

This dataset contains the averages of the mean and standard deviation measures for features selected by accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

The "tidydata" dataset is in wide format and contains 40 observations and 81 variables.

The first two columns are:

activity.name : the activity performed by the subject
subject : identifies the subject who preformed the activity

There are then 79 measurements included in the tidy dataset. These measuerments are the average of ("average.of"):

the mean and std for
tBodyAcc-XYZ: the body acceleration signal measured in X,Y and Z directions

NOTE--this means that the first 6 measurements are: 
  1. the mean for body acceleration in X direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-X) 
  2. the mean for body acceleration in Y direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-Y) 
  3. the mean for body acceleration im Z direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-Z)
  4. the standard deviation for body acceleration in X direction (tBodyAcc-std()-X)
  5. the standard deviation for body acceleration in Y direction (tBodyAcc-std()-Y)
  6. the standard deviation for body acceleration in Z direction (tBodyAcc-std()-Z)
  This pattern continues for all measurements with X,Y and Z
