Code Book for "tidydata":

The "tidydata" dataset is in wide format and contains 40 observations and 81 variables.

activity.name : the activity performed by the subject
subject : identifies the subject who preformed the activity
average.of. : the average of each measurement included in the dataset

There are 79 measurements included in this tidy dataset:

These measuerments are the "average.of":

the mean and std for
tBodyAcc-XYZ: the body acceleration signal measured in X,Y and Z directions

NOTE--this means that the first 6 measurements are: 
  1. the mean for body acceleration in X direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-X) 
  2. the mean for body acceleration in Y direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-Y) 
  3. the mean for body acceleration im Z direction (tBodyAcc-mean()-Z)
  4. the standard deviation for body acceleration in X direction (tBodyAcc-std()-X)
  5. the standard deviation for body acceleration in Y direction (tBodyAcc-std()-Y)
  6. the standard deviation for body acceleration in Z direction (tBodyAcc-std()-Z)
  This pattern continues for all measurements with X,Y and Z 

mean and std for
tGravityAcc-XYZ: the gravity acceleration signal measured in X,Y and Z directions

mean and std for
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ: the body jerk acceleration signal measured in X,Y and Z directions

mean and std for
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ: the body gyro jerk signal measured in X,Y and Z directions
